* Reduce the cost of maintaining Hardware & Software & IT related stuff
  * VM services are easier to use/setup/deploy/snaphot/update/rollback
  * Monitoring services is easier (e.g., charts/reports/status)
  * Easier to do Disaster recovery (DR) and Replication

* Better computational power and pay as you go
